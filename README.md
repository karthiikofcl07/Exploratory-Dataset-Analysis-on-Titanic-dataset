# Exploratory-Dataset-Analysis-on-Titanic-dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, one of the most widely used datasets in data science, sourced from the Kaggle competition “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.” The objective of this project is to explore the dataset using Python, understand patterns influencing passenger survival, and generate meaningful insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.

The analysis emphasizes data cleaning, handling missing values, understanding data types, and identifying relationships between features such as gender, passenger class, age, and survival outcome.

🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

The project was implemented using Python with essential data analysis and visualization libraries. Pandas was used for data manipulation, cleaning, and summary statistics generation. Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for creating visualizations to uncover trends and correlations within the dataset. The project covers key concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis, including handling missing data, converting data types, grouping and aggregating data, and identifying relationships between variables.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset was first inspected to understand its structure, data types, and missing values. Missing values in columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked were handled using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal where necessary. Data types were corrected to ensure accurate analysis, and categorical variables were properly interpreted for grouping and visualization purposes.

📊 Exploratory Analysis

Summary statistics were generated to understand central tendencies and distributions of numerical features. Group-based analysis was performed to examine survival rates by gender and passenger class. The analysis revealed strong patterns indicating that gender and class significantly influenced survival probability.

Bar plots were used to visualize survival rates across different categories, while heatmaps were used to explore correlations between numerical variables. These visualizations provided deeper insights into feature relationships and helped identify key factors affecting survival.

💼 Key Insights and Business Value

The analysis highlights that female passengers and higher-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates. Age and fare also showed meaningful relationships with survival probability. This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, forming a strong foundation for predictive modeling and machine learning tasks.
